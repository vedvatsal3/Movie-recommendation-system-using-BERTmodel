## main.py

This is the main file containing the code for the movie recommendation system. It includes:

- Data ingestion and preprocessing
- User Profile Generation:
- Movie Recommendation
- Feedback loop

## model_comparison.py

Compares 3 different models:
- BERT-based Model
- Collaborative Filtering Model
- Matrix Factorization Model (SVD)

## report

This is a detailed report that explains the overall project, including:

- System Interaction and Components
- System, Feature, and Model Goals
- Pipeline Overview
- Model and Dataset Choices
- Design Choices
- Component Interaction and Adaptability

##  EDA

This file contains the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) code that was used to understand and visualize the dataset.
